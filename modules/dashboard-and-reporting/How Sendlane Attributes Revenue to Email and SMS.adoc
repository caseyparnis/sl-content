==== Overview

Attribution is the process of determining which email or SMS message
most likely led a Contact to complete a transaction, making attribution
a valuable insight into which marketing strategies motivate customers to
purchase. Sendlane allows you to adjust attribution settings so that you
can match previous platforms‚Äô settings or use more or less aggressive
attribution windows and settings than Sendlane‚Äôs default!

Read on to learn more about Sendlane's take on attribution.

[[determination]]
=== How Sendlane determines which message to attribute

Sendlane‚Äôs default attribution settings in the screenshot below
represent the latest industry research and Sendlane‚Äôs deliverability
experts‚Äô experience, which indicate that emails and SMS messages are
rarely revisited after 5 days.

Purchases that meet any channel‚Äôs qualifications will be attributed to
each message individually, even if multiple messages contributed to the
same purchase. This means that if a Contact‚Äôs purchase meets the
qualifications of more than one message‚Äôs attribution settings, such as
an email Campaign and an SMS message sent from an Automation, the
purchase will be attributed to both the email Campaign and SMS message.

==== Email attribution options

* *Opened or clicked emails* - Attribution will be applied to purchases
based on the latest email open or click in the specified window,
whichever is later
* *Opened or clicked emails (excluding Apple Privacy opens)* -
Attribution will be applied to purchases based on the latest email open
or click in the specified window, whichever is later, unless the latest
open was recorded as an Apple Privacy open. When Contacts have
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-mail-privacy-protection-iphf084865c7/ios[Apple
Privacy settings] turned on, all emails delivered to their inboxes are
automatically considered opened. Because the email has not actually been
confirmed opened, this metric is inherently inflated.
* *Clicked emails only* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based
on the latest email click only in the specified window

The specified window for email opens and clicks can be between 1 and 30
days. Sendlane‚Äôs default window is 5 days.

==== SMS attribution options

* *Sent or clicked SMS* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based
on the latest SMS message the Contact was sent or the last SMS message
the Contact clicked in the specified window, whichever is later
* *Clicked SMS* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based on the
latest SMS click only in the specified window

The specified window for sent SMS messages and SMS clicks can be between
1 and 30 days. Sendlane‚Äôs default sent window is 1 day, and the default
clicked window is 5 days.

Sendlane‚Äôs default attribution windows for email and SMS are as follows,
and can be adjusted to fit your marketing strategy‚Äôs needs. If you came
to Sendlane from another provider, we highly recommend adjusting your
attribution settings to match your previous provider for continuity.

Let‚Äôs look at some examples of how to apply the above logic to
real-world scenarios:

* Contact receives an email on day 1, opens the email but does not click
a link on day 2, opens the email and clicks a link and completes a
purchase on day 3. Purchase is attributed to the email click because it
is the last action the Contact took before completing the purchase.
* Contact receives an email on day 1, opens and clicks the email on day
1, but does not make a purchase until day 6. Purchase is not attributed
to the email because the purchase occurred outside of the default 5 day
click window.
* Contact is sent an SMS message on day 1 and clicks the message‚Äôs
tracking link. The Contact makes a purchase on day 4 and the purchase is
attributed to the SMS message.
* Contact receives an SMS message on day 1 and an email on day 2. The
Contact opens and clicks on the email on day 2, then clicks SMS
message‚Äôs tracking link on day 3, and completes a purchase later on day
3 after going back to the website by typing the URL into a new window.
Purchase is attributed to the SMS message and email message because the
Contact met the attribution setting requirements for both channels.

[[sms-sent]]
===== üôã Why is there no open metric for SMS?

Open metrics are made possible for email by the tracking pixel included
in all emails sent from Sendlane. There is no way to embed a tracking
pixel or any other tracker in an SMS message that can determine whether
someone has opened the message or not.

SMS messages tend to have a relatively high open rate compared with
email, which is why some SMS providers display SMS¬†‚Äúopen rates,‚Äù but in
reality, it is only possible to know that the SMS has been sent, which
is why at Sendlane we display sent rates for SMS messages instead of
opens.

[[older]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact interaction with older messages may result in attribution

You may see orders attributed to older messages¬†if contacts open an
older email, click a link in an older email, or click a link in an older
SMS message, and make a purchase¬†without seeing a corresponding open or
click record on the contact's profile. Open and click events are
displayed in a contact's profiles for two weeks after the campaign is
sent. If contacts open or click a campaign after that two-week period,
the open or click will not show on the contact's profile, but it will
still be recorded for the campaign.

This means you may see an order attributed to an older message in a
contact's profile without seeing an open or click record. In the example
below, an order from June 17th is attributed to a campaign sent on May
27th. Even though we can't see it on the contact profile page, this
contact did open the May 27th message within the attribution window
settings.

[[timing]]
=== Timing and timezones

Campaign and Automation email and SMS reports will show attribution for
purchases made within the set window, even if the purchases occurred
days after the message was sent. This means that a purchase tied to an
email opened on the Monday it was sent will be recorded as attributed on
that Monday, even if the purchase was made on the following Thursday.

Attribution windows are based on the
https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-realization/utcnist-time-scale-0[UTC
day]. Attribution windows set to 1 or more days will attribute all
purchases made until UTC+00:00 of the following day.

[[third-party]]
=== View attribution data in third party analytics platforms in addition to Sendlane to confirm performance

We highly recommend that you use third party analytics for outside
confirmation of your marketing attribution data. If you‚Äôre just getting
started with third party analytics, check out
https://help.sendlane.com/article/595-understanding-utm-tracking-options[Understanding
UTM Tracking Options] to learn more. When you‚Äôre ready to get started,
follow the instructions outlined in
https://help.sendlane.com/article/559-global-utm-settings[How to Set Up
Global UTM Tracking] to learn how to turn on global UTM tracking and
adjust UTM tracking for individual messages.

===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Third party analytics may not always match Sendlane

We highly encourage all Sendlane users to integrate with a third party
data analytics platform for the most comprehensive and customizable view
of your marketing data, and it is important to understand that there may
be discrepancies between Sendlane and third party analytics‚Äô attribution
calculations.

Conversion tracking for
https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6331304?hl=en[Google
Analytics] and many other third party analytics providers rely on click
tracking to attribute conversions. This means that GA can‚Äôt record a
conversion if a Contact doesn‚Äôt complete their purchase in the same
session that began when they clicked a tracking link in one of your
messages. Examples of customer journeys that won‚Äôt be tracked with GA
and other click based attribution models include but are not limited to:

* Contact clicks a tracking link in an email, navigates away from your
website, and returns to complete their purchase later
* Contact receives an SMS message, does not click the tracking link, but
goes to your website on their own to complete a purchase
