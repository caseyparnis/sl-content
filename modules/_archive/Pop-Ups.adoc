[[opt-in]]
==== Opt-in Settings

Double opt-in allows you to require Contacts to confirm their
subscription before Sendlane marks them as having consented to receive
your marketing materials. Double opt-in is a great way to protect
yourself from bots and accidental subscriptions! To turn on double
opt-in for your Pop-up:

. Toggle on Double Opt-inÂ 
. Provide a URL to redirect Contacts to when they submit their
information to your Pop-up*
. Click *Edit Confirmation Message* to provide a redirect URL or edit a
thank you message to redirect Contacts to when they confirm their
subscription
. Click *Save*

*There is no thank you message option for Contacts' initial submission
when double-opt in is toggled on for a Pop-up

====== Please Note

You need to have access to the HTML code of your website to install
theÂ Pop-Up.

The "Raw Form" HTML code for theÂ Pop-UpsÂ is not available for the Banner
or Pop-up types. These versions of theÂ Pop-UpÂ need to use JavaScript in
order to function properly.

=== Troubleshooting

*I installed my Pop-Up on my website but I don't see it!*

Check for conflicts caused by plugins or animations on your website that
may be blocking your Sendlane Pop-Up.Â 

*I made changes to my Pop-Up but I don't see them on my website!*

Make sure your pop-up doesn't have any unpublished changes:
