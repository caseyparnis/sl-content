==== Overview

Creating additional users is a great way to allow access to your
Sendlane account without needing to share your account's email address
and password. You can even specify what type of access your users should
have to your account!

[[access]]
===== ⚠️ Role based emails cannot be used for user accounts

Role based email addresses (like info@domain.com, sales@domain.com,
support@domain.com, etc.) cannot be used for user accounts.

[[reuse]]
===== ⚠️ Email addresses cannot be used more than once

If you receive a `+The email has already been taken.+` error when
creating a new user account, the email address is already being used in
Sendlane. Users with
https://help.sendlane.com/article/440-creating-an-account-access-token[agency
access] or multiple Sendlane accounts may need to use plus email
addressing to create a user account. If your email address is
name@example.com and already associated with an agency account or
additional Sendlane account, you can use name+anything@example.com to
create an additional account.
