=== Troubleshooting

[[invalid]]
====== I see "invalid action" or another error when testing my unsubscribe and preferences pages!

Usually these errors are caused by being logged into Sendlane. Try
logging out of Sendlane and testing your links again, if the problem
persists please reach out to your Customer Success Manger or our 24/7
product support specialists!

[[selections]]
====== How can I set up preference options for Contacts to select specific Lists to subscribe to?

Sendlane does not currently provide a way for Contacts to update their
preferences other than unsubscribing from all emails or SMS messages.

[[rearrange]]
====== How can I rearrange the blocks on the Unsubscribe/Profile page?

It is not possible to rearrange the blocks for updating subscription
options, communication preferences, and reporting email abuse.
