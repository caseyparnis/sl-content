[[options]]
=== Attribution qualification and window options

==== Email

* *Opened or clicked emails* - Attribution will be applied to purchases
based on the latest email open or click in the specified window,
whichever is later
* *Opened or clicked emails (excluding Apple Privacy opens)* -
Attribution will be applied to purchases based on the latest email open
or click in the specified window, whichever is later, unless the latest
open was recorded as an Apple Privacy open. When Contacts have
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-mail-privacy-protection-iphf084865c7/ios[Apple
Privacy settings] turned on, all emails delivered to their inboxes are
automatically considered opened. Because the email has not actually been
confirmed opened, this metric is inherently inflated.
* *Clicked emails only* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based
on the latest email click only in the specified window

The specified window for email opens and clicks can be between 1 and 30
days. Sendlane’s default window is 5 days.

[[SMS]]
==== SMS

* *Sent or clicked SMS* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based
on the latest SMS message the Contact was sent or the last SMS message
the Contact clicked in the specified window, whichever is later
* *Clicked SMS* - Attribution will be applied to purchases based on the
latest SMS click only in the specified window

The specified window for sent SMS messages can be between 1 and 24
hours. The specified window for SMS clicks can be between 1 and 30 days.
Sendlane’s default sent window is 24 hours, and the default clicked
window is 5 days.

[[considerations]]
===== ⚠️ Considerations to make before changing attribution settings

* Adjusted attribution settings will be applied to reporting only for
messages sent or Contact actions taken after the changes are made. For
example, if you adjust attribution settings and later a Contact engages
with an older Campaign (sent before the change was made) and makes a
purchase that meet new attribution qualifications, that conversion will
be applied to the older Campaign. Purchases made before the attribution
settings were adjusted that qualify for the new attribution settings
will not be retroactively applied to Campaign reporting.
* Automation attribution will not reset when attribution settings are
updated. Revenue attribution for Automation message nodes will continue
to sum cumulatively when attribution settings are adjusted.
* Attribution settings are applied to Campaigns and Automations as soon
as you click Save Changes.

[[faq]]
=== FAQs

[[CVR]]
====== Why is CVR more than 100% for SMS?

CVR is calculated as conversion count divided by click count. When the
SMS attribution window is set to sent (instead of clicked), there is no
click needed to attribute revenue to a campaign, which can lead to CVR >
100%.

[[multiple]]
====== How are multiple purchases made within the same attribution window counted?

If a Contact makes multiple unique orders that meet attribution setting
specifications, both orders will be attributed to the channel the
Contact engaged with.

[[older]]
====== Why is an old email showing a new attributed purchase after attribution settings were changed?

Purchases made before the attribution settings were adjusted that
qualify for the new attribution settings are not retroactively applied
to Campaign reporting.

You may see orders attributed to older messages if contacts open an
older email, click a link in an older email, or click a link in an older
SMS message, and make a purchase without seeing a corresponding open or
click record on the contact's profile. Open and click events are
displayed in a contact's profiles for two weeks after the campaign is
sent. If contacts open or click a campaign after that two-week period,
the open or click will not show on the contact's profile, but it will
still be recorded for the campaign.

This means you may see an order attributed to an older message in a
contact's profile without seeing an open or click record. In the example
below, an order from June 17th is attributed to a campaign sent on May
27th. Even though we can't see it on the contact profile page, this
contact did open the May 27th message within the attribution window
settings.
